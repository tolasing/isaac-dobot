# CLAUDE.md

Project-specific context for **isaac-cobot**. Kept to the essentials for
working in the sim day-to-day — full history, forensic detail, and "why"
narratives live in `docs/` (linked below) rather than here.

## What this repo is

An NVIDIA Isaac Sim project using cuRobo for collision-aware motion
planning. **There is no physical robot hardware** — everything targets
Isaac Sim only; treat all sim behavior (contact dynamics, motion timing,
gripper interaction) as illustrative, not validated against real hardware.

The active work is a scanner-assembly pick-and-place task built on
`assets/mefron/` — a hand-authored scene (`mefron.usd`: factory floor,
packing tables, and a scanner-assembly CAD mockup — `finger_print_scanner`,
`main_holder`, `screen`, `backpanel_support`). A Franka Panda (cuRobo's own
bundled config) is mounted into this scene and driven by an interactive
cuRobo drag-teleop loop (`motion_gen.plan_single()`); grasp and
assembly-placement poses are derived by manually jogging the robot to a
good pose in the GUI and reading back the relative transform, not measured
on real hardware.

## Where things live

- **This file** — current state, and gotchas that will immediately break
  something if you don't know them.
- `docs/mefron-history.md` — full chronological bug/fix log for every
  mefron script, plus the cuRobo/PhysX/URDF-importer Conventions this file
  only summarizes.
- `docs/grasp-and-assembly-offsets.md` — how the grasp/assembly relative-
  pose constants were derived (`compute_relative_pose()` methodology, the
  abandoned Grasp Editor investigation, the open grasp-centering problem).
- `docs/docker-and-devcontainer.md` — Docker/devcontainer environment setup
  (generic Isaac Sim/cuRobo infra, not scene-specific).
- `examples/curobo_reference/` — pristine, unmodified copy of cuRobo's own
  interactive teleop demo. **Do not modify these two files**; write a
  separate script instead (`scripts/mefron.py` is exactly that). See
  `docs/mefron-history.md` for the environment fixes needed to run it and
  a license caveat on its header comments.
- `scripts/mefron_lib/` — shared package backing every mefron entry-point
  script (`mefron.py`, `mefron_gripper_probe.py`,
  `mefron_grasp_editor_scene.py`, `franka_grasp_editor_scene.py`,
  `test_mefron_*_headless.py`): `kit_bootstrap.py` (packaging preload +
  stale-config cleanup, stdlib-only so it's safe to import before
  `SimulationApp` exists), `config.py` (all constants), `grasp.py` (pose
  math), `robot.py` (mount/friction/drive), `teleop.py` (keyboard control +
  `run_teleop_loop()`). `mefron2.py` (dormant/superseded, see below) keeps
  its own diverged copies of everything except the packaging-preload block.

## Active script + current state

`scripts/mefron.py` is the live script, now a thin entry point over
`scripts/mefron_lib/`: mounts cuRobo's bundled Franka Panda onto
`assets/mefron/`'s `ur10_mount` pedestal (world position
`[2.625260866887235, -4.7019853821770115, 0.8093334035921127]` -- replaced the original SEKTION-cabinet
mount plate once the packing table was swapped for a conveyor line; arm 2 mounts on the
paired `ur10_mount_01` pedestal the same way), runs a drag-follow teleop loop, and provides
one grasp key per `config.GRASP_TARGETS` entry (J: `finger_print_scanner`,
B: `backpanel_support`, via NVIDIA Grasp Editor-exported poses) plus P(lace),
all snapping the teleop target to a live-computed pose, plus C/O keys for
the gripper. Pressing a grasp key also stages that object's own yaml-specified
finger widths (`cspace_position`/`pregrasp_cspace_position`) onto the
`GripperKeyboardControl` instance and immediately opens the gripper to its
pregrasp width — so C/O ramp toward whichever object was grasped last, not
one fixed global width. P's placement pose is computed by measuring the
CURRENT live gripper-to-part offset (not a fixed constant) and applying it
to `finger_print_scanner`'s live-computed target pose on `main_holder` — so
it self-corrects to whatever grasp J actually produced (P is not yet
generalized to `backpanel_support`). There is no G key: an earlier
hand-derived-constant grasp-approach pose has been removed in favor of
J/B. Opens `mefron.usd` directly via `open_stage()`.

`scripts/mefron_gripper_probe.py` imports just the Franka hand +
`panda_leftfinger`/`panda_rightfinger` + `ee_link` (no arm, no motion_gen)
onto its own free-floating `base_link`, for dragging into place against a
part mesh in Stop mode to measure a grasp pose directly, without cuRobo
IK/teleop in the way.

`scripts/build_scene_mefron.py` (+ `configs/scene/mefron_layout.yaml`) is
architecturally preferred — same goal, but a fresh anonymous stage with
`mefron.usd` referenced in, which avoids most of `mefron.py`'s bugs by
construction — but is currently **dormant**: deriving the grasp/assembly
offsets requires temporarily reparenting prims in the Stage tree, which
only works when `mefron.usd` is opened directly, so active work happens in
`mefron.py`. See `docs/mefron-history.md` for both files' full histories.

Current constants (`scripts/mefron_lib/config.py`):
- `GRASP_TARGETS`: dict keyed by object name (`finger_print_scanner`,
  `backpanel_support`), each entry holding the keyboard `key` (a
  `carb.input.KeyboardInput` attribute name, resolved via `getattr` in
  `teleop.py` since `config.py` stays omni/curobo-import-free), `yaml_path`,
  `grasp_name`, and `part_prim_path`. Replaces the old singular
  `GRASP_EDITOR_YAML_PATH`/`GRASP_EDITOR_GRASP_NAME` constants. Finger
  widths themselves aren't stored here — `grasp.compute_grasp_finger_widths_from_file()`
  reads `cspace_position`/`pregrasp_cspace_position` from the yaml live.
- `ASSEMBLY_RELATIONSHIPS["finger_print_scanner_on_main_holder"]`:
  `local_position=[-0.05765, 0.02069, 0.01565]`,
  `local_orientation_wxyz=[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]`. (There is no
  `GRASP_OFFSET_POSITION`/`ORIENTATION_WXYZ` anymore — P measures the
  live grasp offset instead of using a fixed constant; see above.)
- `_TELEOP_VELOCITY_SCALE = _TELEOP_ACCELERATION_SCALE = 0.5`,
  `GRIPPER_CLOSE_SPEED = 0.02` m/s, `GRIPPER_DRIVE_STIFFNESS = 10000.0`.
  `GRIPPER_OPEN_POSITION`/`GRIPPER_CLOSED_POSITION` are now only the
  *default* widths a fresh `GripperKeyboardControl` starts with, before any
  grasp key has been pressed — each grasp key overrides them for the rest
  of the run via `set_grasp_widths()`.
- `OBSTACLE_PRIM_PATHS`: no longer references `packing_table`/
  `packing_table_01` (removed from the scene when it became a conveyor
  line) — now includes both `ur10_mount`/`ur10_mount_01` pedestals instead,
  so each arm treats the other arm's own pedestal as an obstacle too (they
  now sit only ~0.65m apart). Does **not** yet include the new conveyor
  belt/container prims — confirmed live that adding them made cuRobo's
  mesh-collision-world construction hang for over an hour with zero
  progress (each top-level `ConveyorBelt_*` Xform recurses into dozens of
  child meshes; real conveyor-line CAD assemblies are far more complex than
  the single `packing_table` prop they replaced). See "Currently open
  issues" below.

Currently open issues (see the linked docs for full diagnosis):
- **Grasp-centering**: `finger_print_scanner` isn't equidistant from both
  fingertips at grasp time, so one finger contacts first and shifts the
  part sideways. Not a joint/drive asymmetry (explicitly ruled out) — see
  `docs/grasp-and-assembly-offsets.md`.
- **Assembly placement (P) still doesn't land cleanly.** Tried a proper
  lift/translate/rotate/descend redesign 2026-07-17 (the original 2-stage lift baked the *final*
  X/Y into the lift waypoint, so cuRobo swung sideways instead of lifting straight; a 3-stage
  version fixed that but its combined rotate+translate leg made cuRobo hold the old orientation
  until the very end of that leg and snap to final right at the align→descend handoff, a violent
  kickstart) but reverted all of it after finding a deeper, unrelated issue: `ASSEMBLY_LIFT_HEIGHT`
  is a fixed world-frame Z constant — unlike every other pose in this system, which is computed
  relative to a live prim (`main_holder` for `ASSEMBLY_RELATIONSHIPS`, the part itself for grasp
  approach) — so moving `main_holder` (or repositioning the assembly generally) breaks the staged
  sequence outright, since the fixed height has no relationship to wherever things actually are.
  Next attempt should make the lift clearance relative instead — e.g. a margin above whichever of
  the current/final Z is higher — rather than an absolute world height. May or may not also be the
  same grasp-centering issue below; not confirmed either way.
- `attach_objects_to_robot()`/`detach_object_from_robot()` (cuRobo's
  carried-object collision awareness) is not yet wired to the C/O keys —
  `franka.yml` already has a spare `attached_object` link ready for it.
- `main_holder`'s convex-decomposition collision tuning (fixes sinking +
  lost mounting studs) is researched but not yet applied/saved to
  `mefron.usd` — see `docs/mefron-history.md`.
- **Conveyor line has no collision awareness yet.** The new
  `ConveyorBelt_*`/`container_h20*` prims (added when the packing table
  became a conveyor line) are deliberately left out of
  `OBSTACLE_PRIM_PATHS` — confirmed live 2026-07-18 that including even
  just the 5 conveyor + 4 container top-level Xforms made
  `get_obstacles_from_stage()`'s mesh-collision-world construction hang
  (past its own "Creating new Mesh cache: 95" log line) for over an hour
  with zero forward progress, steady CPU/GPU load, and no crash/OOM to
  even signal failure -- had to be killed. Each top-level Xform recurses
  into every child mesh (9 prims -> ~95 individual meshes), and real
  conveyor-line CAD assemblies (rollers, frame, guards, motor housing --
  see the 13-113MB per-file sizes under `Conveyors/`) are far more
  geometrically complex than the single `packing_table` prop they
  replaced -- well past what cuRobo's mesh-based collision checker can
  preprocess in reasonable time. Next attempt should use primitive/cuboid
  obstacle approximations instead of the raw CAD meshes (cuRobo's
  `WorldConfig` supports cuboid obstacles directly), or narrow to specific
  lightweight sub-prims rather than whole assemblies -- not the raw
  top-level Xforms.
- **Arm 2's suction release (L key) doesn't actually let go.** Pressing L
  calls `open_gripper()` (the real `isaacsim.robot.surface_gripper` runtime
  interface), which flips the manager's status to Open, but the object
  stays physically stuck to the gripper -- the only working fix so far is
  manually selecting `SurfaceGripperJoint` under `panda_hand` in the Stage
  panel and unchecking its "Joint Enabled" property by hand every time.
  Tried scripting that exact toggle (`UsdPhysics.Joint`'s
  `physics:jointEnabled` attribute, via `GetJointEnabledAttr()`) from
  `SurfaceGripperKeyboardControl.open()`/`close()` in
  `scripts/mefron_lib/teleop.py` across three variants, all confirmed live
  and all reverted:
  1. `open()` sets `jointEnabled=False` right after `open_gripper()`;
     `close()` sets it back `True` right before `close_gripper()`. L then
     released correctly, but switching target objects mid-session (V on
     `pcb_assembly` right after a prior L+N/M cycle on `screen`) sent the
     arm violently snapping back toward `screen`'s location.
  2. Same, but gated re-enabling on `is_closed()` polled once per frame
     from `_step_arm()` instead of doing it synchronously in `close()`.
     Deadlocked instead -- V never attached again, apparently because the
     manager can't reach `Closed` status while its own joint is disabled.
  3. Re-added `joint.GetBody1Rel().ClearTargets(True)` alongside the
     jointEnabled toggle (on the theory that a stale `body1` binding to the
     previous object was the cause of variant 1's snap) -- no change, same
     violent snap-to-previous-object as variant 1.
  Root cause per `isaacsim.robot.surface_gripper`'s own shipped headers
  (`SurfaceGripperManager.h`/`SurfaceGripperComponent.h` --
  `/isaac-sim/exts/isaacsim.robot.surface_gripper/include/...`): the real
  C++ `SurfaceGripperManager` tracks gripped objects, attachment points,
  and per-joint settling counters (`m_settlingDelay = 10` physics steps) in
  its own memory (`m_writeToUsd` defaults **false** -- it doesn't even
  sync this back to USD by default) and processes attach/detach as
  **queued** PhysX/USD actions drained on its own `onPhysicsStep`, not
  synchronously within the Python call. `SurfaceGripperJoint` is also
  registered as this manager's own attachment point (`IsaacAttachmentPointAPI`),
  so it's independently watching that exact prim for USD change
  notifications. Editing `jointEnabled`/`body1` on it directly from Python
  races the manager's own deferred queue and its `onComponentChange`
  listener, producing a different broken symptom each time depending on
  exactly when the edit lands relative to the manager's own processing --
  not a bug in the manager, but us fighting its ownership of that prim.
  Current code is back to plain `open_gripper()`/`close_gripper()` only
  (matching `isaacsim.robot.manipulators`' own `SurfaceGripper` wrapper and
  the reference `OgnSurfaceGripper` node -- neither ever touches the joint
  directly), i.e. **the manual Stage-panel workaround is still required**.
  Next attempt should look at whether the manual "uncheck" is even doing
  anything physically real (vs. the elapsed time spent navigating the UI
  being what actually lets the manager's own retry/settling logic clear
  itself) before trying to automate it again, or look for a genuine
  reset/detach entry point in `isaacsim.robot.surface_gripper._surface_gripper`'s
  interface beyond `open_gripper()`/`close_gripper()`.

## Must-know gotchas

- **`PhysicsScene` required.** `SingleArticulation.initialize()` (and
  anything else needing a PhysX simulation view) silently breaks without
  a real `PhysicsScene` prim on the stage — nothing in this repo's
  robot-import path creates one automatically. Define one explicitly:
  `UsdPhysics.Scene.Define(stage, "/physicsScene")`.
- **`timeline.play()` timing.** Calling it before `/physicsScene` exists,
  or before a long blocking call like `motion_gen.warmup()` (~30s, no
  `simulation_app.update()` of its own) finishes, corrupts PhysX's tensor
  simulationView — symptom: `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no
  attribute 'link_names'` on the next `SingleArticulation(...)`. Only
  drive `timeline.play()` yourself after both are done; normally a human
  clicks Play in the GUI instead.
- **Stop/Play rebuild.** A `SingleArticulation` is only valid for the
  PhysX simulation view that existed when it was built — clicking Stop
  tears that view down, and reusing a pre-Stop `SingleArticulation` after
  a later Play leaves the robot permanently unresponsive. Any interactive
  loop must track not-playing→playing transitions and rebuild
  `robot`/`idx_list`/`articulation_controller` on *every* fresh Play (see
  `run_teleop_loop()` in `scripts/mefron_lib/teleop.py`).
- **cuRobo plans in the robot's base-link frame, never world space.** Any
  USD world pose (e.g. a dragged teleop target) must go through
  `robot_base_pose.compute_local_pose(world_pose)` first, where
  `robot_base_pose` comes from wherever the robot was actually mounted.
- **URDF importer + file-backed stages.** Importing a robot into a stage
  opened directly from a real `.usd` file (`open_stage()`, what
  `mefron.py` does) makes the importer write a disk-persisted, multi-layer
  "Robot Description" (`configuration/` folder) as a side effect — this
  breaks `CopyPrim`-based duplication of anything under the robot (use
  `prim.GetReferences().AddInternalReference()` instead). A fresh
  anonymous stage with content brought in via `add_reference_to_stage()`
  (what `build_scene_mefron.py` does) avoids this entirely. Full detail:
  `docs/mefron-history.md`.
- **This importer side effect also silently rewrites `mefron.usd` itself
  on every run — not just a stray Ctrl+S risk, an unconditional one.**
  Confirmed live: running any mefron entry-point script (including a
  plain headless verification run with zero explicit save call anywhere
  in this repo's code) changes `mefron.usd`'s on-disk hash every time,
  growing it by however much the just-imported Franka(s) add. Setting the
  stage's edit target to its session layer (`stage.GetSessionLayer()`,
  USD's own built-in "never included in a save" mechanism) does **not**
  prevent this — confirmed by testing against a scratch copy of the
  scene — so the importer is authoring directly onto the root layer
  regardless of the current edit target, not respecting `EditTarget` at
  all. No real fix currently applied; the actual fix would be the
  anonymous-stage-plus-reference architecture above, which isn't usable
  yet for the reason given in `build_scene_mefron.py`'s own section
  above. Until then: (a) treat any diff on `mefron.usd`/
  `configuration/*.usd` after a run as expected noise, not a sign of a
  new bug, (b) never blindly `git checkout` this file — it may carry
  real hand-placed scene edits (e.g. mount-plate positions) alongside the
  incidental Franka bake-in, so reconcile by hand, (c) when testing
  headlessly, prefer running against a scratch copy of
  `assets/mefron/factory floor/` rather than the real file, to avoid
  adding to the noise.
- **Accumulated stray robot prims from the above break rendering, not
  physics.** If a stray Save (or Ctrl+S) ever catches a session mid-run,
  whatever's currently mounted (`/World/Franka`, `/World/Franka2`,
  `/World/Franka3`, and/or the historical intermediate `/panda` path —
  see `mount_franka()`'s docstring for why `/panda` specifically) gets
  baked into `mefron.usd`'s saved root layer as an orphaned leftover.
  Confirmed live: leaving these live during `mefron.py`'s 120-frame
  post-`open_stage()` settle pump lets PhysX/Fabric/Hydra partially
  register the *stale* prims before `mount_franka()`'s own per-path
  cleanup (which only runs right before *that* specific import, too late)
  ever gets a chance to delete+reimport at the same path — the fresh
  reimport's physics/motion-planning end up correct (each arm is driven
  by its own exact, freshly-created prim_path), but the viewport visibly
  desyncs from it: cuRobo successfully plans and drives the joints, the
  arm just never appears to move. Fixed by `robot.clear_stray_robot_prims()`,
  called in `mefron.py` right after `open_stage()` and before the settle
  pump — in-memory `DeletePrims` only, so (like the rewrite itself) this
  needs to run on every fresh `open_stage()`, not just once. Full
  diagnosis: `docs/mefron-history.md`.
- **`SimulationApp` full experience breaks cuRobo's `packaging` import.**
  Passing `experience=.../isaacsim.exp.full.kit` (needed for the Physics
  debug-visualization menu) makes `from packaging import version` resolve
  to a broken internal copy. Fix: pre-load `packaging`/`packaging.version`
  from real `site-packages` before anything else imports cuRobo — see
  `scripts/mefron_lib/kit_bootstrap.py`'s `preload_real_packaging()`,
  called from the top of every mefron entry-point script. Full root-cause:
  `docs/mefron-history.md`.
- **`ninja`/`pip` are broken in this environment.** cuRobo's CUDA kernels
  JIT-compile (needs `ninja`) on a torch ABI mismatch; `pip install`
  itself doesn't work here. Fixed via `apt-get install ninja-build` — see
  `docs/docker-and-devcontainer.md`.
