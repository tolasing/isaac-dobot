# isaac-cobot

A simulated factory cell in NVIDIA Isaac Sim: a real factory-floor backdrop
(vendored from NVIDIA's USD Explorer Sample Assets Pack — not a generic
warehouse), two reused work-surface desks for holding assembly parts, and a
Dobot CR5 6-DOF cobot mounted between them.

There is no physical CR5 hardware behind this project — everything targets
Isaac Sim only. The CR5 is imported from its vendored URDF, cuRobo provides
collision-aware IK / motion generation, and joint-space waypoints are taught
in-sim and played back through `motion_gen.plan_single_js()`. See
[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for the full set of project conventions.

**Status**: both Docker images (`base`, `curobo`) and both devcontainers
build and run against a live RTX PRO 4000 Blackwell GPU — torch, cuRobo,
and `scripts/build_scene.py` (factory + work surfaces + robot mount + a
warmed-up cuRobo `MotionGen`) all verified end-to-end. `build_scene.py`
currently mounts cuRobo's own bundled Franka Panda instead of the CR5, as a
temporary stand-in to validate the pipeline (see
`cr5_mount.robot_override` in `configs/scene/table_layout.yaml`) — the CR5
config itself (`configs/curobo/cr5.yml`) is only partially verified, and
the remaining CR5-specific scripts are still a first draft not yet run
against a live install. See CLAUDE.md's "Needs verification" section for
the current, specific list.

## Prerequisites

- Docker with the NVIDIA Container Toolkit, and an NVIDIA GPU
- (Optional) [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the
  [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

## Quickstart

Two Docker profiles are available: `base` (plain Isaac Sim) and `curobo`
(adds cuRobo, pinned to the commit in `docker/.env.curobo`).

```bash
# Build + start a container, then attach a shell
python docker/container.py start base      # or: curobo
python docker/container.py enter base      # or: curobo

# Inside the container
python scripts/build_scene.py
python scripts/import_cr5.py
python scripts/teach_waypoint.py --name home
python scripts/playback_waypoints.py

# From the host, when done
python docker/container.py stop base       # or: curobo
```

Or open this repo in VS Code and use "Reopen in Container" with either
`.devcontainer/base` or `.devcontainer/curobo`.

## Workspace layout

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `robots/cr5/` | Vendored CR5 URDF + meshes (MIT, see `robots/cr5/SOURCE.md`) |
| `assets/factory/` | Vendored factory backdrop (not in git — see `assets/factory/SOURCE.md`) |
| `docker/` | Container profiles (`base`, `curobo`) and the `container.py` CLI |
| `.devcontainer/` | VS Code devcontainer configs matching the two Docker profiles |
| `configs/scene/` | Factory pruning rules, work-surface placement, and robot mount |
| `configs/curobo/` | cuRobo robot config + collision spheres for the CR5 |
| `configs/rmpflow/` | Deferred — cuRobo is the primary IK/motion-gen path |
| `scripts/` | Scene builder, URDF importer, cuRobo setup, waypoint teach/playback |
| `data/waypoints/` | Recorded waypoints (joint-space JSON) |
| `tests/` | Pure-Python checks for configs/waypoints (no Isaac Sim required) |

## Development

```bash
pip install .[dev]
ruff check .
ruff format --check .
pytest
```
