"""Loads cuRobo's bundled Franka Panda, a draggable teleop target, and a
warmed-up cuRobo MotionGen into assets/mefron/factory floor/mefron.usd -- a
separate, already hand-authored stage (its own factory backdrop, two
packing tables, and a scanner-assembly CAD mockup), distinct from this
repo's main table_layout.yaml-driven scene.

Standalone: does not import build_scene.py. The only other repo script
reused here is import_cr5.py, a generic URDF-import utility already
designed to be used as a library (see its own docstring). Everything else
below (cuRobo obstacle scan/MotionGen setup, teleop target, the
drag-follow loop) is implemented directly in this file rather than reused
from build_scene.py, because build_scene.py's own versions carry
assumptions from the main scene's stage (an anonymous, in-memory
SimulationApp stage, never opened from an existing file) that don't hold
for mefron.usd (opened via omni.usd.get_context().open_stage() -- a real,
file-backed stage). Three real, confirmed-live problems this caused, and
why each is fixed the way it is:

  - build_scene.py's run_teleop_loop() hardcodes a check for /physicsScene
    (lowercase) before creating one -- it has no way to know about a
    differently-named, pre-existing scene on a stage it didn't build
    itself (mefron.usd already has its own /PhysicsScene, capitalized,
    authored by hand in the GUI). Having both active at once breaks the
    robot's PhysX articulation view entirely: isaacsim.core.prims logs
    "Physics Simulation View is not created yet" on every frame, and
    get_joints_state() never returns non-None, so the robot never
    responds to the target. Fixed here by owning the physics-scene check
    directly (run_teleop_loop() below): check for a valid scene at either
    the lowercase or capitalized path and reuse whichever exists, only
    defining a new one if genuinely neither does -- never two at once.
  - build_scene.py's build_teleop_target() uses the CopyPrim command to
    duplicate the end-effector's visuals prim -- confirmed live that
    CopyPrim's shallow, spec-level copy produces a prim with a completely
    empty bounding box here (checked via UsdGeom.BBoxCache), unlike the
    main scene where the same pattern works. Root cause, also confirmed
    live: Isaac Sim's URDF importer detects that mefron.usd is a real,
    file-backed stage (unlike the main scene's anonymous in-memory one --
    see the importer's own "Creating Asset in an in-memory stage, will not
    create layered structure" log line, which only fires for the
    anonymous case) and organizes the imported robot into a separate,
    disk-persisted "configuration/mefron_*.usd" multi-layer structure --
    Kit's own designed behavior for file-backed stages, not overridable by
    calling stage.SetEditTarget() beforehand (confirmed live: the importer
    resets the edit target itself regardless of what it was set to).
    CopyPrim's raw spec copy can't correctly re-resolve a same-layer
    reference across that more complex layer stack once relocated to a
    new prim path. Fixed in build_teleop_target() below by using an
    internal USD reference instead
    (prim.GetReferences().AddInternalReference()) -- a live pointer at the
    already-*composed* result, not a copy of raw specs, so it renders
    correctly no matter how many layers underlie the source. Confirmed
    live: non-empty bbox with real, plausible extents for a gripper mesh.
  - Calling timeline.play() before cuRobo's motion_gen warmup (which
    blocks the main thread for ~30s calling no simulation_app.update() of
    its own) leaves physics "playing" across a long unpumped real-time
    gap, which corrupts PhysX's tensor simulationView by the time the drag
    loop's own SingleArticulation gets constructed -- confirmed live,
    crashes every time with `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no
    attribute 'link_names'`. This script never calls timeline.play() at
    all -- matching build_scene.py's own convention, a human clicks Play
    in the GUI, and run_teleop_loop() below already waits for
    is_playing() itself and prints a reminder until it does.

One more side effect worth knowing, not a bug fixed here: every URDF
import into mefron.usd (whether from this script or manual GUI use)
writes real files to disk under
"assets/mefron/factory floor/configuration/" (a multi-MB mefron_base.usd
plus smaller physics/sensor/robot sublayers) -- confirmed via file mtimes
matching exactly when these sessions ran. This is Kit's own robot-import
behavior for file-backed stages (see above), not something this script
does deliberately. Not currently gitignored.

Mount pose: world (2.74097, -4.782, 0.7924), identity orientation -- directly
on top of /World/sektion_cabinet_instanceable, the SEKTION cabinet table that
replaced the original Pedestal_plates/Cube_05 mount plate (removed from
mefron.usd; see mefron_layout.yaml's cr5_mount comment for the full story).
This script originally targeted the old pedestal and was updated to match
once that mount changed -- MOUNT_POSITION here is the same value
mefron_layout.yaml's own cr5_mount.position uses.

Drive-strength/damping/URDF-path/motion_gen_robot_cfg constants below are
copied from table_layout.yaml's own cr5_mount.robot_override block (cuRobo's
own tuned Franka values, not a guess -- see that file's comment for
provenance).

Only creates its own SimulationApp when run standalone (same convention as
build_scene.py/import_cr5.py).

    """Drag `target` in the GUI viewport; the robot follows via cuRobo's
    MotionGen. Ported from build_scene.py's own run_teleop_loop() (see
    that file for the original's own detailed design notes -- the
    debounce/plan/apply logic below is unchanged) with these differences:

      - The physics-scene check reuses whichever of /physicsScene or
        /PhysicsScene already exists on mefron.usd, rather than
        unconditionally creating a new /physicsScene -- see this module's
        own docstring for why the original's version breaks here.
      - The original only ever builds its SingleArticulation once (gated
        by `idx_list is None`, checked just on the very first Play).
        Confirmed live: clicking Stop in the GUI tears down PhysX's
        simulation view entirely; on a later Play, the original code kept
        reusing the now-stale SingleArticulation, producing an endless
        "Physics Simulation View is not created yet" warning and a robot
        that never responds again for the rest of that process. This
        version tracks not-playing-to-playing transitions and rebuilds
        `robot` (and resets all per-session state) on every fresh Play,
        not just the first one.
      - Trajectory playback is gated on real elapsed time (result.interpolation_dt)
        instead of one waypoint per render frame -- ported from
        build_scene_mefron.py's identical fix. Confirmed there live at ~119
        FPS against a plan generated for 50Hz (interpolation_dt=0.02s):
        one-waypoint-per-frame played the whole trajectory back at ~2.4x its
        intended speed and cut its final deceleration-to-zero-velocity ramp
        short, leaving real residual velocity for the position-hold drive to
        absorb once cmd_plan ran out -- the actual cause of both too-fast
        motion and an arrival oscillation, not a stiffness/damping problem.
        This script's own render rate was never separately confirmed, but the
        mechanism is identical regardless of the exact FPS -- one waypoint per
        frame is only correct by coincidence if FPS happens to equal 1/interpolation_dt.
      - `gripper_control`: if given, the Franka's two finger joints are driven
        directly to GRIPPER_OPEN_POSITION/GRIPPER_CLOSED_POSITION every playing
        frame based on `gripper_control.closed`, independent of cmd_plan/cuRobo
        -- ported from build_scene_mefron.py's identical block; see
        GRIPPER_JOINT_NAMES' comment above for why fingers are locked out of
        cuRobo's own IK/trajopt (franka.yml's lock_joints).
      - plan_config now sets time_dilation_factor=_TELEOP_TIME_DILATION_FACTOR,
        not cuRobo's own default speed -- see that constant's own comment for
        why this (not velocity_scale/acceleration_scale) is the correct knob
        for "slower, more deliberate" motion.
      - `gripper_control` also gates two one-shot snap-to-pose requests (G/P
        keys, see GripperKeyboardControl): G snaps `target` to
        compute_grasp_approach_pose() (the gripper pose that grasps
        finger_print_scanner wherever it currently sits), P snaps it to
        compute_assembly_grasp_target() (the gripper pose that places an
        already-grasped scanner correctly onto main_holder wherever it
        currently sits). New in this file, not ported from
        build_scene_mefron.py -- see ASSEMBLY_RELATIONSHIPS/
        GRASP_OFFSET_POSITION's own comments for how T_H_S/T_S_G were
        derived.
