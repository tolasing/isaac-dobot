"""Builds /World/Factory (backdrop), two reused ErgoTable desks near the
robot, imports+mounts the CR5 cobot (or, temporarily, a Franka Panda --
see cr5_mount.robot_override) between them, warms up a matching cuRobo
MotionGen (best-effort -- skipped if cuRobo isn't installed, e.g. the
`base` Docker profile), and -- when cuRobo is available and not running
--headless -- runs an interactive teleop loop: drag the ghost end-effector
target in the GUI viewport and the robot follows via MotionGen.plan_single().

Verified against a live Isaac Sim 5.1.0 install (isaac-cobot-base
container, real GPU). The factory backdrop asset loads asynchronously --
main() pumps a bounded number of frames after building so a one-shot
--headless run sees it fully resolved before pruning/mounting/printing.

Only creates its own SimulationApp when run standalone (`__main__`), same
reasoning as import_cr5.py -- safe to import as a library from a script
that already has one running (confirmed the hard way: importing this
module after a second SimulationApp already exists segfaults instead of
raising).

Run standalone:
    ${ISAACSIM_ROOT_PATH}/python.sh scripts/build_scene.py
(opens the full local GUI experience, isaacsim.exp.full.kit)

Add --livestream to stream the scene remotely instead, by loading the same
isaacsim.exp.full.streaming.kit experience file
/isaac-sim/isaac-sim.streaming.sh uses -- connect with whichever client you
already used for that script. Don't run isaac-sim.streaming.sh at the same
time; this invocation replaces it (both would try to bind the same
streaming session). --headless (used by test_teleop_headless.py) stays a
separate, minimal-experience fast check.

hide_ui=False is required alongside headless=True here: SimulationApp's own
wrapper auto-appends --/app/window/hideUi=1 whenever headless=True and
hide_ui isn't explicitly set (see isaacsim/simulation_app/simulation_app.py's
_start_app), which is what silently drops the full UI down to viewport-only
-- isaac-sim.streaming.sh doesn't hit this because it invokes the Kit binary
directly, bypassing this Python wrapper's default entirely.

        to safely prefix-match anywhere in the tree (e.g. "Link1", which
        also names our own CR5's first arm link).
