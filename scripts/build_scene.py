"""Builds /World/Factory (backdrop), two reused ErgoTable desks near the
robot, imports+mounts the CR5 cobot (or, temporarily, a Franka Panda --
see cr5_mount.robot_override) between them, and warms up a matching cuRobo
MotionGen (best-effort -- skipped if cuRobo isn't installed, e.g. the
`base` Docker profile).

Verified against a live Isaac Sim 5.1.0 install (isaac-cobot-base
container, real GPU). The factory backdrop asset loads asynchronously --
main() pumps a bounded number of frames after building so a one-shot
--headless run sees it fully resolved before pruning/mounting/printing.

Only creates its own SimulationApp when run standalone (`__main__`), same
reasoning as import_cr5.py -- safe to import as a library from a script
that already has one running (confirmed the hard way: importing this
module after a second SimulationApp already exists segfaults instead of
raising).

Run standalone:
